            <p>Skiing is the use of skis to glide on snow for basic transport, a recreational activity, or a competitive
                winter sport. Many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the International Olympic
                Committee
                (IOC), and the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS).Skiing has a history of almost five
                millennia.[1] Although modern skiing has evolved from beginnings in Scandinavia, it may have been
                practiced more than 100 centuries ago in the Altai Mountains, according to an interpretation of ancient
                paintings.[2][3] However, this continues to be debated.[4][5]

                The word "ski" comes from the Old Norse word "skíð" which means to "split piece of wood or firewood".[6]

                Asymmetrical skis were used in northern Finland and Sweden until at least the late 19th century. On one
                foot, the skier wore a long straight non-arching ski for sliding, and a shorter ski was worn on the
                other foot for kicking. The underside of the short ski was either plain or covered with animal skin to
                aid this use, while the long ski supporting the weight of the skier was treated with animal fat in a
                similar manner to modern ski waxing.</p>
